# Data-Analyst-Capstone-Project
For this capstone project, I assumed the role of an Associate Data Analyst at a technology consulting organization. My primary task was to analyze the data and obtain valuable insights into current and future technological trends using the latest Stack Overflow Developer Survey dataset. These insights will play a key role in guiding strategic business decisions. 

As a Data Analyst, I analyzed data to answer key questions about the use of technology. I analyzed trends in programming languages, databases, platforms, and frameworks, focusing on those technologies professionals currently use and those they aim to learn in the future. Through careful analysis, I extracted insights that highlight emerging patterns and shifts in the tech landscape. These findings were then presented to various stakeholders in the organization for informed decision making. 

Started the project by collecting data using API access and web scraping techniques.After gathering the data, engaged in various data wrangling tasks, including handling duplicates, identifying and addressing missing values, and normalizing the data. After ensuring data is accurate and ready for analysis, performed Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA. At this stage, I examined the distribution of responses and identify patterns in developer preferences and technology trends. This involves plotting distribution curves and histograms, detecting outliers that may skew your analysis, and exploring correlations between various features in the dataset. Once I have a solid grasp of the data, I engaged in data visualization, creating visualizations that effectively display trends and relationships. I created various types of visualization, such as histograms, scatter plots, pie charts, and bar charts to make your findings visually engaging and easy to interpret. Following the visual analysis, I built interactive dashboards using IBM Cognos Analytics or Google Looker Studio. The dashboards are divided into three distinct parts, each focusing on different aspects of technology usage and trends. These parts include Current Technology Usage Dashboard, Future Technology Trends Dashboard, Demographics Dashboard. 

Each step of the data analysis process is shown in different notebook of this repository and some aditional files needed for their understanding.
